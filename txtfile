we run install express to install packs

we make docker file base node and we copy packs + source code on it to make our image 

==> we make .dockerignore file to ignore copying unnesessary files

then we build image and remember -t is for tag 

when we are runing container we use --log-driver=json-file to store log on a json file 
==> file path is on local host /var/lib/docker/cont-id/id.json


we made a docker compose file to increase the availabibity of the app and apply these  two concepts

Redundancy: If one container fails, the other two can continue running, reducing downtime.

Load Distribution: If configured with a load balancer, traffic can be evenly distributed across these containers
